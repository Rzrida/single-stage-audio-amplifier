# single-stage-audio-amplifier

Project Statement
Design a single-stage audio amplifier circuit using a BJT transistor. The amplifier should operate in the active region, provide a voltage gain of at least 50, and handle an input signal of 30 mV peak-to-peak. Specify the component values (resistors, capacitors, etc.), draw the circuit diagram, and explain the working of the amplifier, including how you achieved the desired gain and ensured stable operation. Use an 8Ω or 16Ω speaker as the load to test the amplifier.
